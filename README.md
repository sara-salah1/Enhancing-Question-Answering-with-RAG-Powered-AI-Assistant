# Enhancing-Question-Answering-with-RAG-Powered-AI-Assistant

## Overview 
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered Question Answering (QA) assistant utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver accurate, contextually relevant answers to customer queries. The assistant will leverage the SANAD dataset for information retrieval and combine it with generative AI capabilities to provide precise and detailed responses.

## Features
- **Knowledge Base Creation:** Efficiently structured and indexed SANAD dataset for optimal retrieval performance.
- **RAG Model Development:** Integration of retrieval and generative components to deliver accurate and contextually relevant answers.
- **Customer Support Integration:** Seamless incorporation into a customer support platform with a user-friendly interface.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository:

2. Install Dependencies
3. Download the SANAD Dataset: Download the dataset from Kaggle SANAD Dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
4. run app.py


## Usage

- **Interacting with the AI Assistant:**

     - Navigate to the customer support platform.
